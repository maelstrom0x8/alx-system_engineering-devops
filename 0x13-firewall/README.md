# Firewalls

This is my first time configuring a firewall. I have 3 ubuntu servers but for practical
purporse I'm just going to be running the configs on one of them.

## 0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but
Running this script will set the firewall to deny incoming and allow outgoing connections by default
and allow incoming connections for SSH, HTTP/HTTPS.
